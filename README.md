Android calculator project

This project was a semester project of mine for Android development. It's a calculator written in Java.

The main calculator uses on click listeners to perform the calculations. History is stored and is displayed to the user on a second view/activity using a recycler view. An adapter controls the recycler view, and a model holds the information needed to complete the transactions.
